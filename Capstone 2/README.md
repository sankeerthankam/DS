---
### Objective
The objective of this project is to build a recommendation system using `content-based` and `collaborative-filtering`. 

---
### Target Audience and Why

---
### The Data
Most of the data is gathered from `Kaggle` while additional data required for this project is scraped from IMDB's official website using Python's `tmdbsimple` library.

Users - `user_id`, `age`,	`sex`,	`occupation`,	`zip_code`
Movies - `movie_id`, `title`, `release_date`, `video_release_date`, `imdb_url`, `genres`
Ratings - `user_id`, `movie_id`, `rating`, `timestamp`

After scraping the data, we have some additional data about the movies

Metadata - `overview`, `tagline`, `description`, `imdb_id`, `title`, `vote_average`, `vote_count`
Keywords - `id`,	`keywords`

### Approach
The goal of this project is to build recommendation systems using different approaches. Below are the jupyter notebooks and their respective tasks. 

- Capstone 2 - Demonstrates data pre-processing and EDA
Web Scraping - Jupyter Notebook with code to scrape data from IMDB
Popularity Based Recommendation System - Code for Popularity Based Recommendation System 
Description Based Recommendation System - Code for Description Based Recommendation System 
Metadata Based Recommendation System - Code for Metadata Based Recommendation System 
Collaborative Filtering - Code for Collaborative Filtering
