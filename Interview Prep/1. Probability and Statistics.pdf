Probability is the determining factor in Predictive Analytics.

There are basically two hypothesis.

    Null
    Alternative

Null Hypothesis : There is no significant difference between specified population

Alternative Hypothesis: There is significant difference

How do we determine which hypothesis to accept?

If p <= 0.05 we reject Null Hypothesis

If p > 0.05 we accept Null Hypothesis

So, what does accepting or rejecting an hypothesis mean?

If we accept Null Hypothesis, it means the value or the feature or independent variable, doesn't help us in predicting the dependent or target variable.

If we reject Null Hypothesis, it means that particular feature will help us in predicting the dependent or target variable a.k.a label.

So, how do we calculate the p-value?

We get the p-value by analysing the summary of linear relation formed between the features(independent variable (Xs)) and target(dependent variable(y)).

The linear regression will try to form a relation between these variables through a straight line, using the formula:

y = m*X +B

The points that are nearer to regression line or on the regression line are most significant and they have the p <=0.05 so we consider them as features that are required to predict y.

The points that are further away from regression line are the non-significant one, with p>0.05 so these values are not required to predict target variable y.
